            <figcaption>Green Bean Chicken Breast is a healthy option that took me a bit of time to come around to when
                I was cutting back on calories and points. For months I would just order Kung Pao Chicken, Beef and
                Broccoli and Mushroom Chicken
                without wanting to branch out.
